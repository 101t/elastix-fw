Elastix Firewall
================

This script used to read all extensions then check it if it is **ONLINE** then it is ok, else **UNKNOWN** or **UNREACHABLE** then firewall will open for few seconds to re-enable these extensions to be **ONLINE** again.

This script works cron-job, iptables and asterisk telephony framework, also you can install it inside Elastix Server under `/home/fw/` folder.
